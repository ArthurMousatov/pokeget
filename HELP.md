## Basic Syntax
`pokeget [flags] <pokemon national dex id>`

Example: `pokeget 282`

*No flags are required for the program to run*

## Flags
### Small
Makes the pokemon a smaller sprite. In the pokemon games, this would be the sprite found when browsing the pokemon storage system.

### Big
Makes the pokemon a big sprite. In the pokemon games, this would be the sprite found of your opponents pokemon while battling.

### Shiny
Dictates wether the pokemon is shiny. It only works on big sprites. 

*Note: the shiny colors are from pokemon reborn, so a lot of them are completely different than the normal shiny colors.*

### Variant
This flag dictates a lot of things, such as: Wether the pokemon is mega, alolan form, pokemon specific things such as arceus, and a few other attributes.
    
Also, the format of this flag is -variant <number>, so keep that in mind.
